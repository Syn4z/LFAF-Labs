## Theory
A deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is a type of finite automaton that has a unique transition for each input symbol 
from any given state. In other words, the next state of the DFA is uniquely determined by the current state and the input
symbol. DFAs are often used in computer science and programming to model processes that have a finite number of possible
states, such as parsing strings or recognizing patterns.

A nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) is a type of finite automaton that may have multiple possible transitions for
a given input symbol from any given state. To convert an NFA to a DFA, we need to find a way to represent all possible
combinations of states that the NFA could be in after processing a given input symbol. This is typically done using a 
subset construction algorithm, which constructs a new DFA from the NFA by representing each combination of states as a 
single state in the DFA.

## Objectives:

* Understand what an automaton is and what it can be used for.
***  
* Continuing the work in the same repository and the same project, the following need to be added:

  * a. Provide a function in your grammar type/class that could classify the grammar based on Chomsky hierarchy.

  * b. For this you can use the variant from the previous lab.

***
* According to my variant number, get the finite automaton definition and do the following tasks:

  * a. Implement conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar.

  * b. Determine whether your FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.

  * c. Implement some functionality that would convert an NDFA to a DFA.

  * d. Represent the finite automaton graphically (Optional, and can be considered as a bonus point)



## Implementation description

* Made rules for each grammar type on the Chomsky classification.

```
    ...
        is_type_3 = True
        for nonTerminal in self.nonTerminal:
            for production in self.productions[nonTerminal]:
                if len(production) > 2 or (production[0] not in self.terminal and production[0]
                                           not in self.nonTerminal) or (
                        len(production) == 2 and production[1] not in self.nonTerminal):
                    is_type_3 = False
                    break
        if is_type_3:
            return 'Type 3'
        ...    
```

* The function to convert a finite automaton to regular grammar, add new start symbol, non-terminal symbol and add 
rules

```
    ...
    startSymbol = self.startState
        productions[startSymbol] = [self.startState]

        for state in self.states:
            productions[state] = []

        for acceptState in self.acceptStates:
            for state in self.states:
                if acceptState == state:
                    productions[state].append("ε")

        for transition in self.transitions:
            q, a, p = transition
            productions[q].append(a + p)
    ...
```

* This function checks if an FA is deterministic or non-deterministic.

```
      ...
           for state in self.states:
            transitions = [t for t in self.transitions if t[0] == state]
            labels = [t[1] for t in transitions]
            if len(labels) != len(set(labels)):
                return 'Non-Deterministic'
        ...        
```

* This is where the transitions for the DFA are calculated.

```
      ...
            for symbol in dfa_alphabet:
                next_states = self.epsilon_closure(self.move(state_set, symbol, self.transitions), self.transitions)
                if len(next_states) > 0:
                    dfa_transitions.append((state_set, symbol, frozenset(next_states)))
                    if frozenset(next_states) not in processed_states:
                        queue.append(frozenset(next_states))
            ...
```

## Conclusions / Results

### Conclusion
This laboratory work explored different concepts related to formal languages and automata. I implemented a function to
classify a grammar based on the Chomsky hierarchy, a conversion of a finite automaton to a regular grammar, and a 
determination of whether the FA is deterministic or non-deterministic. I also implemented functionality to convert an 
NDFA to a DFA, which is important because DFAs are easier to work with than NFAs and can be used to manipulate and 
analyze the language generated by the automaton. Additionally, the laboratory work provided practical experience in 
working with grammars and automata, and I learned how to represent the automaton graphically, which can be useful in many
applications.
